# Week Sidoarjo (Week 2)
Starting Operations

## SKU
- A small amount of fast moving sku
- Get items directly from a small amount of suppliers Victory and Oripack
- Siapkan alat bahan untuk siap packing: Kardus bekas, bubble, lakban, fragile, gunting, cutter
- ask TGR if I can get a list of suppliers that I can direcly Order fullfillment from #Action
- **Offline**: Start shipping from here [[SOP#Half Loading Full Loading]]
- **Olshop**: Start olshop, sales amount depends on the market

## People/Unload
- 4 People: 1 Week with thursday as the beginning of the week [^3]
	- 1 team lead
	- 3 staff

## Stock Balancing
- Main_Office does stock in and stock out, Buffer space is sent Nomor Invoice only.
- Stock Balancing is checked daily after first Order Proses batch (~10am)
### Schedule/Routing
1. See if truck route is going to Sidoarjo 
2. [[SOP#Stock Balancing]]


# Week Start Ops (Week 4)
- SDA is now Main_Warehouse, not buffer storage.
- Tronton and Fuso unloads here now (Monday Tronton goes to SBY)
- The founder stays and lives at SDA
- Train an admin olshop, start the olshop. (The current place is a huge physical constraint more anything, with more space I can have more people and more training)
- If I'm ~~crazy~~ bold enough, I could just rent a kos and get someone to be an admin olshop force them to be there
- Start packing operations
- Start stock rotation discipline
## SKU
- All SKU [^1]
- **Offline**: Shipping is mainly from here [[SOP#Half Loading Full Loading]]
- **Olshop**: Start olshop, sales amount depends on the market

## People/Unload
- At least 6 people

## Stock Balancing
- SBY still gets Tronton [^2]
- Stock Balancing is checked daily after first Order Proses batch (~10am)
- [[SOP#Stock Balancing]]
- Stock is based on Pergerakan Stock
	- Initial: Use `kali_max_gdg` **SBY** value for BOTH SDA and SBY.
	- 2 weeks of stable outflow: Use `kali_max_gdg` per warehouse using 14 days
	- 4 weeks of stable outflow: Use `kali_max_gdg` per warehouse normally

## Stock Rotation Discipline
- Change where we take pallets, rotate old stocks

## Main Office
- Move 1 person in chatting
- [[docs/Sidoarjo/TODO#Main_Office]]



# Week Stable
Main_Office is now moved to SDA
## SKU
- all SKU exists with appropriate qty
- Failure point: Once fast moving SKU needs to be limited by kali_max_gdg (0.75) a new place must be considered and split the moving SKUs #Limits #Investigate_Minor
## People
- A full single shift for packing and warehouse
- 2 shifts both for packing and warehouse
## Office
- Sidoarjo is now the Main_Office
## Dev_team
- Get a large table where dev can work
- does not need to be divided with sales_team, let them overhear and interact
	- Cons: reduce productivity 10%. Fix: allow headphones
	- Pros: Increase inter department cohesion
## Construction_team
- 
## Truck
- Kecil 1 di SBY, Sedang 1 di SDA (parking cost reduction)


# Future
## Kitchen_team
- find a chef (cari emak2)
